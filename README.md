# Proiect-Vector.cpp
This project is based on the template side of Object Oriented Programming in C++. 
My main class is a template class of "< class T, unsigned int >", where T is a dinamically allocated array of n spaces, simulating a math 
vector. The rest part of the program is operator overloading on '=' (assignment), '<<' (output), '>>' (input), '+' (sum of 2 vectors), 
'*' (product of 2 vectors) etc. All of these functions are template functions.
